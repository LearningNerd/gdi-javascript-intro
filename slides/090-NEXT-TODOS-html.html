	<h2>NEXT</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>1 or 2 minute overview of the DOM -- document at the top, the rest is in a hierarchy (show diagram?)</li>
		<li>30 second intro to objects: think of it as a bucket of variables and functions grouped together (show diagram?)</li>
		<li>using document.innerHTML to put stuff on the HTML page, using console and using JS file</li>
		<li>document.getElementById, test in concolse and in JS file</li>
		<li>input.value, test in console and then in JS file</li>
		<li>addEventListener, simplified intro. its 2nd parameter requires.. another function! like whooa!</li>
		<li>introduce how to define and run a custom function.. maybe do a game where everyone writes functions that interact with each other somehow</li>

			<!-- TOPICS ON CREATING CUSTOM FUNCTIONS, for later:

				- function keyword to define a function, ( optional parameters ), { body }
				- return statement and/or side effects
				- parameters / arguments -- 0, 1, 2, or many more
				- functions have TWO STEPS: defining them, and later calling them
					- define it once, use it as many times as you want (same with variables!)
				- after defining, function name followed by ( ); to call/run a function
				- CHALLENGE: create a function that replaces the contents of the whole page with "hello world"
			-->
