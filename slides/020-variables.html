	<h2>VARIABLES</h2>
	<p>What is a variable?</p>
	<p>A variable is a piece of information that can change over time</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
		var myName = 'Ms Awesome';
	</code></pre>
	<p>Copy and paste that into your console, hit enter to run the code. Then type "myName" and hit enter.</p>
	<p>NOTE: we show that on the projector in the console too</p>

	<h2>Things to know about variables:</h2>
	<ul>

	<h2>Creating New Variables</h2>
	<p>Variables can be created with no value (undefined), or with a value:</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var favoriteAnimal;
var favoriteColor = 'blue';
	</code></pre>
</section>

	<h2>Changing the Value of a Variable</h2>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var favoriteFood = 'burgers';
favoriteFood = 'pizza';
	</code></pre>
	<p>Try it yourself in your console!</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Variables are saved to memory</h2>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
		favoriteAnimal = "penguin";
	</code></pre>
	<p>Try it yourself in your console!</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Variable Types: Strings, numbers, etc</h2>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var verb = 'running';
var number = 3;
	</code></pre>
	<p>Plus more, which we'll talk about later!</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>A couple notes about strings</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Strings are always surrounded by quote marks such as <b>' '</b> or <b>" "</b></li>
		<li>A number within a string is not a number, it is text, thus part of the string</li>
	</ul>

	<p>***other important string things here? </p>

	<h2>Connecting Strings Together</h2>
	<p>Fancy name for it: concatenation!</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
		var sentence = 'My name is ' + myName + ' and I rock!';
	</code></pre>
	<p>Now type "sentence" and hit enter, and you'll see the output: <b>I am a penguin and I rock!</b></p>
</section>

<section>
	<p>Now copy all of this code and run it in your console!</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var madLibs = "I got home yesterday and say a " + favoriteAnimal + " eating " + favoriteFood + " on my dining table. I asked the " + favoriteAnimal + " what was going on, but it blinked at me " + number + " times, and left " + verb + " away"
	</code></pre>
	<p>NOTE: point out that previous vars were saved in memory. that's why we don't have to define them again.</p>
	<p>TODO: different madlib using all previous variables from examples</p>
