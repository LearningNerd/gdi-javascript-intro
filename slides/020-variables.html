	<h2>VARIABLES</h2>
	<p>What is a variable? (A piece of information that can change over time)</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var myName = 'Ms Awesome';
	</code></pre>
	<p>Copy and paste that into your console, hit enter to run the code. Then type "myName" and hit enter.</p>
	<p>NOTE: we show that on the projector in the console too</p>
</section>

<section>
	MAIN POINTS:
	- can contain different kinds of values, or none at all (undefined)
	- variable can be named almost anything **maybe mention rules? http://girldevelopit.github.io/gdi-featured-js-intro/class1.html#/14
	- names are CASE SENSITIVE
	- no spaces
	- when you make a new variable, define it with "var"

	<h2>Creating New Variables</h2>
	<p>Variables can be created with no value (undefined), or with a value:</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var hometown;
var favoriteColor = 'blue';
	</code></pre>

	<h2>Changing the Value of a Variable</h2>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var favoriteFood = 'burgers';
favoriteFood = 'pizza';
	</code></pre>
	<p>Try it yourself in your console!</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Variable Types: Strings, numbers, etc</h2>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var verb = 'running';
var number = 3;
	</code></pre>
	<p>Plus more, which we'll talk about later!</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>A couple notes about strings</h2>
	<p>Strings are always surrounded by quote marks, can be ' ' or " "</p>
	<p>***other important string things here? </p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2>Connecting Strings Together</h2>
	<p>Fancy name for it: concatenation!</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var sentence = 'My name is ' + myName + ' and I rock!';
	</code></pre>
	<p>Now type "sentence" and hit enter, and you'll see the output: I am a penguin and I rock!</p>
</section>

<section>
	<p>Now copy all of this code and run it in your console!</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var MadLib = exclamation + '! he said ' + adverb + ' as he jumped into his convertible ' + noun + ' and drove off with his ' + adjective + ' wife.'
	</code></pre>
	<p>NOTE: point out that previous vars were saved in memory. that's why we don't have to define them again.</p>
	<p>TODO: different madlib using all previous variables from examples</p>
