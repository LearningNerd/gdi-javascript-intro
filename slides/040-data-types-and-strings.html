	<h2>Data types</h2>
	<p>Variables can contain different types of data, like strings, numbers, and more!</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var adjective = 'purple';
var favoriteNumber = 3;
	</code></pre>
	<p class="small">The computer stores everything as 1s and 0s, but it <em>interprets</em> the 1s and 0s differently depending on what data type they are.</p>
	<p class="small" style="margin-top:30px;">For example: "0001" might represent the number 1, the letter A, the value TRUE, or something else!</p>

	<h2 style="font-size:1.5em;">A chunk of text is called a <strong>string</strong></h2>

	<p>Strings are a bunch of symbols <em>strung</em> together into a sentence, just like alphabet beads on a necklace.</p>
	<!--
	LATER: section on converting data types:
		<li class="fragment highlight-current-blue">If a string contains a number (<code>var myString = "5"</code>), the computer treats it as text.</li>
	Also later:
	- escaping strings, special characters
	-->
	</ul>
	<img src="img/letter-beads.jpg" class="noborder">

	<p>Strings are always surrounded by quote marks, either single (<code class="green bold">' '</code>) or double (<code class="green bold">" "</code>).</p>
	<p class="small">It doesn't matter which you choose, as long as the opening and closing quote marks match!</p>

	<h2 style="font-size:1.2em;">What if your string contains a quote mark?</h2>
	<p>Since strings are always surrounded by quote marks, if your string also <em>contains</em> a quote mark,<br> you'll run into trouble!</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var brokenString = 'I think I'm doing this wrong!';
	</code></pre>
	<p>Try it out in the console. Did you get an error?</p>
	<p>Let's see how to fix it...</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2 style="font-size:1.4em;">Solution 1: Use different quote marks</h2>
	<p>You can use double (<code class="green bold">" "</code>) quote marks to surround a string containing a single quote:</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var fixedString1 = "I think I'm doing this right!";
	</code></pre>

	<p>Or vice versa, you can use single quotes (<code class="green bold">' '</code>) to surround a string containing a double quote:</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var fixedString2 = 'I shouted "Yay!" when it worked.';
	</code></pre>
</section>

<section>
	<h2 style="font-size:1.4em;">Solution 2: Escaping characters</h2>
	<p>You can <strong>escape</strong> special characters like quote marks by adding a backslash (<code class="green bold">\</code>) in front of them:</p>
	<pre style="margin: 50px 0;"><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var fixedString3 = 'Yay, I\'m escaping strings!';
	</code></pre>

	<p>Escape notation is also used for printing special characters like tab (<code class="green bold">\t</code>) and new line (<code class="green bold">\n</code>).

	<h2>Connecting strings together</h2>
	<p>So you've already defined some strings like <code>favoriteAnimal</code> and <code>favoriteFood</code>, but how can you combine them into a sentence?</p>

	<!--
		ASK: if you were inventing your own programming language, how would you do it?
		Get a couple volunteers to say what they would type, before showing answer.

	-->

	<pre class="fragment"><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
		var sentence = 'My name is ' + myName + ' and I rock!';
	</code></pre>
	<p class="fragment">Try it! Run this code in your console. Then type "sentence" and hit enter, and you'll see the output:<br> <b>I am Sally Awesomepants and I rock!</b></p>
	<p class="fragment small blue" style="margin-top:40px;"><strong>Note:</strong> The console remembers the <code>myName</code> variable that you defined earlier, because it's saved in memory until you close your browser tab. Neat, huh?</p>
</section>

<section>
	<p style="margin-bottom:60px;">Now run this code in your console:</p>
	<pre><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
var madLib = 'Yesterday I found a ' + adjective + ' ' + favoriteAnimal + ' with ' + favoriteNumber + ' eyes eating ' + favoriteFood + ' on my dining table and writing JavaScript on my computer! It wrote some code that concatenated strings, so I ran the code and the ouput was: ' + sentence;
	</code></pre>
	<p style="margin-top:60px;">After running the code, remember to type <code>madLib</code> and hit enter to see the value of the madLib string!</p>
</section>

<section>
	<h2 style="font-size:1.3em;margin-bottom:60px;">Combining strings = concatenation</h2>
	<p>The fancy technical term for combining strings is called <strong class="green">concatenation</strong>. Say that ten times fast!</p>
	<p style="margin-top:60px;">When used with strings, the <strong>+</strong> symbol is called the <strong>concatenation operator</strong>.</p>
