	<h2>JavaScript comments</h2>
	<p>Comments are ignored by the computer but very useful for us humans to keep our code organized:</p>
	<pre style="font-size:0.6em;"><code class="javascript" data-trim contenteditable="">
// This is a single-line comment.

/*	This is a multi-line comment!

  Comments help us humans stay sane. You can use them for:
  - notes to explain how your code works
  - to-do lists and reminders
  - links to sources or references, like this one about JS comments:
